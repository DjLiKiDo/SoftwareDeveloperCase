## Implementation Plan

This plan addresses the request to restructure and optimize the codebase, focusing on the structural aspects first as per the prompt. User feedback has been incorporated.

### Phase 1: Preparation and Clarification
- [x] Initial analysis of the request and existing workspace structure.
- [x] Formulate clarifying questions for the user.
- [x] User feedback received and incorporated.
- [x] **WAIT** for user approval of the updated plan before proceeding to Phase 2. (Approved)

### Phase 2: One Class Per File
- [ ] Scan the codebase (all C# projects: Api, Application, Domain, Infrastructure) for files containing multiple class, struct, interface, or enum definitions.
- [ ] For each identified file:
    - [ ] Create new files for each additional type, naming the file after the type (e.g., `MyClass.cs` for `class MyClass`).
    - [ ] Move the type definition to its new file.
    - [ ] Ensure the namespace in the new file is correct (initially, it will be the same as the original file; will be updated in Phase 4).
    - [ ] Update using statements in the original and other affected files if necessary.
- [ ] ⏸️ **CHECKPOINT**: Request human to compile the solution (`dotnet build`) and confirm no functionality is broken. All tests should pass (`dotnet test`).

### Phase 3: Directory Structure Reorganization

    - `ApiResponse.cs` (if using a generic wrapper)
- `HealthChecks/` (existing)
- `Extensions/` (e.g., for `IServiceCollection` extensions specific to API setup)

**Steps for Phase 3:**
- [x] For each layer (Domain, Application, Infrastructure, API), create the new directory structures as proposed above.
- [x] Move existing files to their new locations according to the new structure.
    - [x] Domain: Organized entities into Team/, Project/, Task/ subdirectories
    - [x] Application: Moved DTOs into Features/{Feature}/DTOs/ folders
    - [x] Infrastructure: Organized into Persistence/SqlServer/ structure with proper subdirectories
    - [x] API: Organized controllers into V1/ and moved request/response models to Models/
- [x] Delete old/empty directories after moving files.
- [x] ⏸️ **CHECKPOINT**: Request human to review the new directory structure. Compile the solution (`dotnet build`) and confirm no functionality is broken. All tests should pass (`dotnet test`). (Note: Namespaces will be fixed in Phase 4, so build errors due to namespaces are expected at this stage if not preemptively updated, but the primary check is file organization).

### Phase 4: Namespace Organization
- [x] Analyze all C# files to identify namespace mismatches with directory structure
- [x] Identified 20+ files that need namespace updates across Infrastructure, API, and Domain layers
- [x] Update Infrastructure layer namespaces (Migration files fixed)
- [x] Update API layer namespaces (Controller and model namespaces aligned)  
- [x] Update Domain layer namespaces (Role entity relocated)
- [x] Update using statements across the codebase to reflect new namespaces
- [x] Fixed EmailService namespace conflicts (Email namespace vs Email type)
- [x] Resolved DbContext namespace conflicts 
- [x] Human made manual edits to repository files and migration designers
- [x] Fix remaining 3 DependencyInjection errors (DbContext and Services references)
- [x] ⏸️ **CHECKPOINT**: Request human to compile the solution and confirm no functionality is broken. All tests should pass.

### Phase 5: Review Dependency Injection and SOLID Principles
- [x] Review existing `DependencyInjection.cs` files in Api, Application, and Infrastructure layers. Ensure they align with the new structure and SOLID principles.
- [x] Ensure DI registrations correctly point to types in their new namespaces/locations.
- [ ] During all refactoring steps, apply SOLID principles where appropriate (e.g., ensuring classes have a single responsibility after being split).
- [ ] Focus on ensuring DI is correctly used and its configuration is aligned with the new structure.
- [ ] ⏸️ **CHECKPOINT**: Request human to review DI setup and overall structure. Compile and test.

### Phase 6: Final Review and Cleanup
- [ ] Run `dotnet format` on the entire solution.
- [ ] Ensure all tests pass (`dotnet test`).
- [ ] Review changes for adherence to all project instructions and coding standards.
- [ ] **WAIT** for final human approval.

- ⏳ In progress: Phase 5 - DI and SOLID Principles Review

## Current Priority: Complete Phase 5
**Status**: Reviewing dependency injection and SOLID principles

**Initial findings**:
1. ✅ DI configuration is well-structured with appropriate separation across layers
2. ✅ Namespace references in DI classes are correct (no compilation errors)
3. ✅ All tests pass, showing DI container is correctly configured
4. 🔄 Reviewing repository registration for potential improvements
5. 🔄 Analyzing service lifetimes for optimization opportunities
6. 🔄 Checking for potential SOLID principle violations

**Improvement areas to investigate**:
1. Cached repository pattern implementation may benefit from a more consistent approach
2. Consider using interface-based registration for all services
3. Evaluate transient vs. scoped lifetime choices for services
4. Look for opportunities to better separate cross-cutting concerns

**Next steps**:
- Continue detailed review of DI setup
- Identify any specific improvements per SOLID principles
- Prepare recommendations for human review
