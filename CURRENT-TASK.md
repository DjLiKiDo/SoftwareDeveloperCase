# CURRENT-TASK: GitHub Copilot Agent Optimization - Phase 1

**Start Date**: 2025-06-01
**Related to**: Improve development efficiency with GitHub Copilot Agent
**Current Phase**: Phase 1 - Workspace Base Configuration

## Context

- **Project**: SoftwareDeveloperCase - Project management REST API
- **Architecture**: Clean Architecture (.NET 8)
- **Stack**: CQRS + MediatR, EF Core, JWT, FluentValidation, AutoMapper
- **Existing Documentation**: Detailed instructions in `.github/instructions/agent.instructions.md`

## Phase 1 Implementation Plan

### 1.1 VS Code Settings Optimization

- ✅ Configure intelligent workspace indexing
- ✅ Enable better contextual suggestions
- ✅ Optimize configurations for .NET projects
- ✅ Configure irrelevant file exclusions

### 1.2 Specialized Instructions Structure

- ✅ Create api.instructions.md
- ✅ Create testing.instructions.md
- ✅ Create database.instructions.md
- ✅ Create architecture.instructions.md
- ⏸️ CHECKPOINT: Test improved suggestions with new structure

## Current Status

- ✅ Completed: Project analysis and existing documentation review
- ✅ Completed: Detailed optimization plan creation
- ✅ Completed: Translation of plan to English
- ✅ Completed: VS Code workspace optimization (settings.json, extensions.json)
- ✅ Completed: Domain-specific instruction files creation
- ⏸️ **READY FOR PHASE 1 CHECKPOINT** - Test improved suggestions

## Files Created

- `docs/COPILOT_OPTIMIZATION_PLAN.md` - Complete optimization plan (English version)
- `.vscode/settings.json` - VS Code workspace optimization for Copilot
- `.vscode/extensions.json` - Recommended extensions for development
- `.github/instructions/api.instructions.md` - REST API development guidelines (with file type specifications)
- `.github/instructions/testing.instructions.md` - Testing patterns and practices (with file type specifications)
- `.github/instructions/database.instructions.md` - Entity Framework and data access patterns (with file type specifications)
- `.github/instructions/architecture.instructions.md` - Clean Architecture guidelines and patterns (with file type specifications)
- `.github/instructions/application.instructions.md` - Application layer CQRS, DTOs, and validation patterns (with file type specifications)
- `.github/instructions/domain.instructions.md` - Domain layer DDD patterns, entities, and value objects (with file type specifications)
- `.github/workflows/copilot-setup-steps.yml` - Automated development environment setup for GitHub Copilot (moved to workflows directory)

## Latest Improvements

- ✅ Added `applyTo` directives to all instruction files for precise file targeting
- ✅ Enhanced each instruction file with specific file type applications
- ✅ Created comprehensive Application layer instructions (CQRS, DTOs, validation)
- ✅ Created comprehensive Domain layer instructions (DDD, entities, value objects)
- ✅ All instruction files now include detailed patterns and examples for their specific scope
- ✅ **REGENERATED** `copilot-setup-steps.yml` following official GitHub Actions format
- ✅ Optimized environment setup based on official GitHub Copilot documentation
- ✅ Added comprehensive .NET 8 development environment configuration
- ✅ Integrated automated testing, database setup, and development tools installation
- ✅ Created development helper scripts for common tasks

## Decisions Made

- 5-phase structure prioritized by impact
- Focus on domain-specific specialized instructions
- Reusable templates and prompts for common patterns
- Quantifiable success metrics
