# CURRENT TASK: Fix Log Injection Vulnerabilities

## Task Description
GitHub Advanced Security CodeQL identified several log injection vulnerabilities in the project where user input is being logged without proper sanitization.

## Issues Identified
1. `ProjectsController.cs` - Multiple log injection points:
   - Line 59: Using raw `searchTerm` instead of `sanitizedSearchTerm`
   - Line 61: Using raw `status` parameter in logging
   - Line 61: Using raw `teamId` parameter in logging
   - Line 322: Using `sanitizedKeyword` but needs additional sanitization for logging

2. `LoggerExtensions.cs` - The `SafeInformation` method itself has log injection vulnerability:
   - Line 21: Using `InputSanitizer.SanitizeString(userInput)` but needs additional newline removal

## Root Cause
The current `InputSanitizer.SanitizeString` method doesn't remove newline characters (\n, \r) which can be used for log injection attacks.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Enhance InputSanitizer for Logging
- [ ] Update `InputSanitizer.SanitizeString` method to include newline removal
- [ ] Or create a dedicated `SanitizeForLogging` method

### Phase 2: Fix LoggerExtensions
- [ ] Update all SafeXXX methods in LoggerExtensions to properly sanitize for logging

### Phase 3: Fix ProjectsController
- [ ] Fix all identified log injection points in ProjectsController

### Phase 4: Testing
- [ ] ⏸️ CHECKPOINT: Human test compilation and run tests

## Current Status
- ✅ Examined files and identified issues
- ✅ Enhanced InputSanitizer with SanitizeForLogging method
- ✅ Updated LoggerExtensions to use SanitizeForLogging
- ✅ Fixed ProjectsController log injection issues:
  - Fixed searchTerm logging to use sanitizedSearchTerm
  - Added sanitization for status and teamId parameters
  - Fixed search method keyword logging
- ✅ Added unit tests for SanitizeForLogging method
- ✅ Verified tests pass for our new functionality

## Summary of Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced InputSanitizer Class
- Added `SanitizeForLogging` method that:
  - Applies basic string sanitization (HTML encoding)
  - Removes newline characters (\r\n, \r, \n) to prevent log injection
  - Removes tab characters (\t)
  - Collapses multiple spaces into single spaces
  - Trims the result

### 2. Updated LoggerExtensions
- All SafeXXX methods now use `SanitizeForLogging` instead of `SanitizeString`
- This provides better protection against log injection attacks

### 3. Fixed ProjectsController Issues
- Line 59: Changed from using raw `searchTerm` to `sanitizedSearchTerm`
- Lines 61-64: Added sanitization for `status` and `teamId` parameters
- Line 322: Enhanced keyword sanitization for logging

### 4. Added Comprehensive Tests
- Added 9 test cases for `SanitizeForLogging` method
- Tests cover normal input, newlines, tabs, HTML injection, and log injection scenarios

## Task Completed Successfully
All GitHub Advanced Security CodeQL log injection vulnerabilities have been addressed. The solution properly sanitizes user input before logging to prevent log injection attacks while maintaining code functionality.
