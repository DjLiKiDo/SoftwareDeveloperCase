# Fix CI/CD Workflow Path Issue

## Problem
The GitHub Actions workflow has an incorrect path in the publish step:
```
dotnet publish SoftwareDeveloperCase.Api/SoftwareDeveloperCase.Api.csproj
```

Should be:
```
dotnet publish src/SoftwareDeveloperCase.Api/SoftwareDeveloperCase.Api.csproj
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Fix Project Paths
- [ ] Update the publish command path in ci-cd.yml
- [ ] Verify all other project paths are correct in the workflow
- [ ] ⏸️ CHECKPOINT: Human verification of the fix

### Current Status
- ✅ Completed: Fixed publish command path from `SoftwareDeveloperCase.Api/` to `src/SoftwareDeveloperCase.Api/`
- ⏳ Pending: Human verification of the fix
