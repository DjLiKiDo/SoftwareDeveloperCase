Based on the provided context, please:

1. Generate a detailed Product Requirements Document (PRD) that includes:
   - Project overview and objectives
   - Target audience
   - Core functionality
   - Technical requirements 
   - Key performance indicators
   - Success metrics

2. Define a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for the initial release by:
   - Identifying essential features
   - Setting scope boundaries
   - Establishing technical constraints
   - Defining acceptance criteria

3. Create a prioritized task breakdown that:
   - Lists all tasks needed to reach MVP
   - Estimates effort/complexity
   - Determines dependencies
   - Includes specific GitHub Copilot prompts for each task
   - Groups tasks into logical development phases

Please provide the source document or context to enable a comprehensive analysis and detailed planning process.

Each task should follow this format:
- Task ID
- Description 
- Dependencies
- Estimated effort
- Technical constraints
- Acceptance Criteria
- Functional Requirements
- Quality Assurance
- GitHub Copilot prompt template: 
  "I need to [task objective]. The requirements are [specific details]. Please help me implement this using [technology/framework]."
