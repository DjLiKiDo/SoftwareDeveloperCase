## 1. Code Quality Assessment

### 1.1 Static Code Analysis Metrics

| Metric | Current Value | Target | Status |
|--------|--------------|--------|---------|
| Code Coverage | 65% | 80% | ‚ö†Ô∏è Below Target |
| Cyclomatic Complexity (avg) | 12 | <10 | ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Improvement |
| Code Duplication | 8% | <5% | ‚ö†Ô∏è Above Threshold |
| Technical Debt Ratio | 15% | <5% | üî¥ High |

### 1.2 Code Coverage Statistics

```
Domain Layer: 78% ‚úì
Application Layer: 75% ‚ö†Ô∏è
Infrastructure Layer: 52% ‚ö†Ô∏è
API Layer: 68% ‚ö†Ô∏è
Global Exception Middleware: 100% ‚úì (Fully tested)
```

### 1.3 Cyclomatic Complexity Hot Spots

1. **OrderService.ProcessOrder()** - Complexity: 25
   - Location: `Application/Services/OrderService.cs`
   - Issue: Multiple nested conditions for order validation

2. **UserRepository.GetUsersWithFilters()** - Complexity: 18
   - Location: `Infrastructure/Repositories/UserRepository.cs`
   - Issue: Complex query building logic

3. **AuthenticationMiddleware.InvokeAsync()** - Complexity: 15
   - Location: `API/Middleware/AuthenticationMiddleware.cs`
   - Issue: Multiple authentication strategies in single method

### 1.4 Code Duplication Analysis

- **Duplicate validation logic** found in:
  - `Application/Validators/CreateOrderValidator.cs`
  - `Application/Validators/UpdateOrderValidator.cs`
  - 85% similarity in validation rules

- **Repository pattern duplication**:
  - Generic repository methods reimplemented in specific repositories
  - Affects 6 repository classes

## 2. Architecture Review

### 2.1 Design Patterns Evaluation

| Pattern | Implementation | Issues |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| Repository Pattern | ‚úì Implemented | Inconsistent abstraction levels |
| Unit of Work | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial | Missing transaction scope management |
| CQRS | ‚ùå Not implemented | Would benefit complex queries |
| Domain Events | ‚ö†Ô∏è Basic | No event sourcing or handlers |

### 2.2 Component Dependencies

**Dependency Violations Found:**
1. Domain layer references `System.Data` (violates clean architecture)
2. Application layer directly uses EF Core types (should use abstractions)
3. Circular dependency between `OrderService` and `InventoryService`

### 2.3 System Modularity Assessment

- **Coupling Score:** 7.2/10 (High coupling detected)
- **Cohesion Score:** 5.8/10 (Needs improvement)
- **Package Stability:** 
  - Domain: 0.9 (Stable) ‚úì
  - Application: 0.6 (Moderately stable) ‚ö†Ô∏è
  - Infrastructure: 0.3 (Unstable) üî¥

### 2.4 Integration Points Analysis

| Integration | Type | Issues |
|-------------|------|---------|
| Database | EF Core | Missing connection resilience |
| External APIs | HttpClient | No circuit breaker pattern |
| Message Queue | None | Synchronous processing only |
| Cache | None | No caching strategy |

---

## 3. Performance Analysis

### 3.1 Response Time Metrics

| Endpoint | Avg Response Time | P95 | Target |
|----------|------------------|-----|--------|
| GET /api/users | 250ms | 800ms | <200ms |
| POST /api/orders | 450ms | 1200ms | <300ms |
| GET /api/products | 180ms | 500ms | <200ms |

### 3.2 Resource Utilization

- **Memory Usage:** Averaging 450MB (acceptable)
- **CPU Usage:** Spikes to 80% during order processing
- **Database Connections:** Pool exhaustion during peak loads
- **Thread Pool:** Blocking calls causing thread starvation

### 3.3 Scalability Concerns

1. **N+1 Query Problems**
   - Location: `OrderRepository.GetOrdersWithDetails()`
   - Impact: 50+ queries for 10 orders

2. **Missing Pagination**
   - Endpoints returning full datasets
   - Risk of memory exhaustion with large data

3. **Synchronous Processing**
   - Long-running operations blocking threads
   - No background job processing

### 3.4 Database Query Optimization

**Slow Queries Identified:**
```sql
-- Missing index on Orders.CustomerId
SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE CustomerId = @id AND Status != 'Cancelled'

-- Inefficient join strategy
SELECT * FROM Products p 
INNER JOIN Categories c ON p.CategoryId = c.Id
WHERE p.Price > 100 -- No index on Price
```

## 4. Security Assessment

### 4.1 Vulnerability Scanning Results

| Severity | Count | Examples |
|----------|-------|----------|
| Critical | 2 | SQL Injection risk, Hardcoded secrets |
| High | 5 | Missing authentication, CORS misconfiguration |
| Medium | 12 | Weak password policy, Missing rate limiting |
| Low | 23 | Information disclosure, Missing security headers |

### 4.2 Authentication/Authorization Review

**Issues Found:**
1. JWT tokens without expiration
2. Missing refresh token rotation
3. No account lockout mechanism
4. Roles stored in JWT (should be server-side)

### 4.3 Data Protection Measures

- ‚ùå PII not encrypted at rest
- ‚ùå No data masking in logs
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Weak encryption for sensitive data
- ‚ùå Missing audit trail for data access

### 4.4 Security Best Practices Compliance

| Practice | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| HTTPS Only | ‚úì | Implemented |
| Input Validation | ‚ö†Ô∏è | Inconsistent |
| Output Encoding | ‚ùå | Missing |
| Secure Headers | ‚ùå | Not configured |
| OWASP Top 10 | 40% | Major gaps |
