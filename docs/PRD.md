- 99.9% uptime SLA

#### 3.4 Security Requirements
- HTTPS enforcement
- JWT token expiration (15 minutes)
- Refresh token rotation
- Rate limiting per user/IP
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection

### 4. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- 20+ active teams
- 50+ active projects
- < 1% error rate
- 95% uptime

#### 5.2 Long-term (12 months)
- 1000+ registered users
- 200+ active teams
- 500+ active projects
- < 0.5% error rate
- 99.9% uptime

### 6. Non-Functional Requirements

#### 6.1 Scalability
- Horizontal scaling capability
- Database connection pooling
- Caching strategy implementation
- Async operations throughout

#### 6.2 Maintainability
- Comprehensive documentation
- Clean code principles
- Automated testing suite

| Data breach | High | Low | Implement security best practices, regular audits |
| Performance degradation | Medium | Medium | Implement caching, optimize queries |
| Feature creep | Medium | High | Strict MVP scope, phased releases |
| Technical debt | Medium | Medium | Regular refactoring, code reviews |

### 10. Timeline

- **Phase 1 (MVP)**: 8 weeks - Core functionality
- **Phase 2**: 4 weeks - Enhanced collaboration features
- **Phase 3**: 4 weeks - Performance optimization
- **Phase 4**: Ongoing - Maintenance and improvements
