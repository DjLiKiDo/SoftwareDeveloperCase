**Status:** âœ… **COMPLETED** - Implementation finished successfully  
**Completion Date:** June 7, 2025  
**Priority:** ðŸ”´ High  
**Dependencies:** None  
**Estimated Effort:** 16 hours (2 days)  
**Actual Effort:** ~16 hours

**Technical Constraints:**

**âœ… COMPLETION SUMMARY:**

**Implemented Components:**

- Result<T> and Result classes in Application.Models namespace
- Factory methods: Success, Failure, NotFound, ValidationFailure
- BaseController with HandleResult methods for proper HTTP status mapping
- Authentication error handling (401 Unauthorized)
- Comprehensive error categorization (400, 401, 404, 422)

**Updated Handlers (All Return Result<T>):**

- Auth domain: LoginCommand, RefreshTokenCommand, ChangePasswordCommand
- User domain: DeleteUser, InsertUser, UpdateUser, GetUserPermissions
- Role domain: InsertRole, AssignRole, AssignPermission
- Project domain: CreateProject, GetProjects

**Controllers Updated:**

- AuthController, UserController, RoleController, ProjectsController
- All inherit from BaseController and use HandleResult methods

**Test Coverage:**

- All unit tests updated and passing (100% success rate)
- Integration tests updated for proper HTTP status codes
- LoginCommandHandlerLockoutTests migrated from exception-based to Result<T>
- AuthControllerTests now properly returns 401 for invalid credentials

**Key Achievements:**

- Eliminated exception-based error handling in favor of Result<T> pattern
- Consistent API response structure across all endpoints
- Proper HTTP status code mapping with authentication error support
- Zero test failures - all tests passing
- Solution builds successfully with no compilation errors

**GitHub Copilot Prompt:**

```
I need to implement a Result<T> pattern for consistent API responses. The requirements are:
- Generic Result<T> class with IsSuccess, Value, Error, and ValidationErrors properties
- Factory methods for Success, Failure, NotFound, and Invalid
- Implicit operators for clean syntax
- Global middleware to transform Result<T> to appropriate HTTP responses
Please help me implement this using .NET 8 and Clean Architecture principles.
